<p>Using a potentiometer connected to an arduino,</p> <p>pass analog values to a python script, through serial,</p><p> and change an html file to reflect a change of color based on the received values.</p>
<p><b>The way this code is set up you can expect 10 new tabs to open as you are moving the potentiometer.</b></p>
